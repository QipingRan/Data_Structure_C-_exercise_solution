// Let c(n) be the number of different groups of integers that can be chosen from the integers 1
//  through n âˆ’ 1 so that the integers in each group add up to n (for example, 
//  n = 4 = [1 + 1 + 1 + 1] = [1 + 1 + 2] = [2 + 2] ). Write recursive definitions for c(n)
//   under the following variations:

// You count permutations. For example, 1, 2, 1 and 1, 1, 2 are two groups that each add up to 4.

// You ignore permutations.
